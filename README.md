## Developed from the Ground Up:
I single-handedly constructed this project from the ground up, utilizing my coding expertise to bring its vision to life. This was due to being the sole team member with the necessary programming capabilities.

Three Distinct Perspectives:

The website is designed to cater to three distinct user roles, each with unique functionalities and access levels:

## Static:
Represents the default, read-only mode of the website.
Ideal for general information dissemination and passive browsing.

## Student:
Grants users the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Empowers students to submit application forms specifically tailored for college or senior high enrollment.

## Admin:
Holds the highest level of authority within the website.
Unlocks advanced CRUD actions, including:
Accepting or rejecting student application forms.
Managing student accounts (creation, deletion, and modification).
Overseeing additional administrative tasks and system maintenance.
